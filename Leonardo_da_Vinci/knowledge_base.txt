**Factual Knowledge Base: Leonardo di ser Piero da Vinci**

**Section 1: Personal Details**
- Full Name at Birth: Lionardo di ser Piero da Vinci.
- Born: April 15, 1452, in the town of Vinci, Republic of Florence, Italy[450][451].
- Died: May 2, 1519, in Amboise, Kingdom of France[451].
- Parents: He was born out of wedlock to Ser Piero, a wealthy Florentine notary, and a peasant woman named Caterina[454].
- Upbringing: He received little formal education in Latin and mathematics but was apprenticed at around age 14 to the prominent artist Andrea del Verrocchio in Florence[455].
- Personal Habits: He was a known vegetarian and had a deep love for animals[452]. He wrote in his notebooks using a characteristic "mirror writing" script (right to left).

**Section 2: Major Artistic Works**
- **The Last Supper (1495–1498):** A large mural in Milan depicting the moment Jesus announces one of his apostles will betray him. Painted using an experimental technique (tempera and oil on dry plaster) which led to its rapid deterioration[455].
- **Mona Lisa (c. 1503–1519):** A portrait of Lisa Gherardini. Famous for its subject's enigmatic smile and the use of the 'sfumato' technique (soft, hazy transitions between colors). Leonardo never considered the painting finished and kept it with him until his death[455].
- **Vitruvian Man (c. 1490):** A world-renowned drawing based on the work of the Roman architect Vitruvius. It depicts a man in two superimposed positions with his arms and legs apart and inscribed in a circle and square, representing ideal human body proportions[454].
- **The Virgin of the Rocks (c. 1483–1486):** A painting with two versions (one in the Louvre, one in London's National Gallery) notable for its use of light and shadow (chiaroscuro).

**Section 3: Scientific and Engineering Work**
- **Anatomy:** He conducted over 30 dissections of human and animal bodies to understand the mechanics of the body. His anatomical drawings of the heart, vascular system, and a fetus in the womb were centuries ahead of their time[455]. He referred to the eye as the "window of the soul" and believed sight was the most important sense[455].
- **Inventions (Conceptual):** He filled dozens of notebooks with sketches and designs for inventions. Many were conceptual and never built in his lifetime[453].
    - **Flying Machines:** Designs for an ornithopter (a machine that flies by flapping wings like a bird) and a precursor to the helicopter (the 'aerial screw').
    - **Military Engineering:** Designs for an armored fighting vehicle (a precursor to the tank), a giant crossbow, and portable bridges[452][453].
    - **Hydraulics & Civil Engineering:** Extensive studies of water flow, canal systems, and a design for a double-hulled ship.
- **Botany & Geology:** He studied the structure of plants and was one of the first to understand that fossils were the remains of ancient life, challenging the biblical flood narrative.

**Section 4: Career & Patrons**
- **Early Career:** Began in Florence in the workshop of Andrea del Verrocchio[455].
- **Milan (c. 1482–1499):** Worked for Ludovico Sforza, Duke of Milan, as a painter, sculptor, and military engineer. The massive bronze horse statue he planned was never completed[455].
- **Later Years:** Worked in Florence, Rome, and eventually moved to France in 1516 at the invitation of King Francis I, where he spent his final years[450].
